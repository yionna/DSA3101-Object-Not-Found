                Marketing efforts in the banking industry have shifted away from traditional methods like mass media marketing to digital marketing, as clients become more digitally savvy. Current digital marketing efforts rely mostly on broad demographic segments and basic metrics, underutilising available consumer data. Our team’s marketing specialists have thus asked for our expertise in identifying the relevant segments to target their marketing campaign and come up with strategies to address low engagement with customers. Our team and data scientists have thus proposed creating more personalised marketing strategies that are tailored to customers’ preferences, behaviours and needs.
