Focus on retention strategies by promoting entry-level products, such as low-cost savings accounts. Physical outreach may be necessary, especially for those who lack digital capability.\n",

Priority should be given to offering personalized premium services, loyalty rewards, and investment opportunities. They will appreciate a mix of digital convenience and dedicated relationship management for a high-touch experience.\n",

    "3. **Affluent Observers**:\n",
    "   - **Financial status**: High\n",
    "   - **Loyalty**: Low or Moderate\n",
    "   - **Business Insight**: These financially capable customers engage selectively, focusing on the most beneficial investment products rather than broad engagement with the bank's offerings. Often busy professionals or high-income earners, they have significant spending potential if attracted to the right opportunities. Increase engagement by offering exclusive perks, premium credit cards, or specialized mortgage products tailored to their selective investment approach. Emphasize digital convenience to make interactions quick and accessible, suiting their busy lifestyles and encouraging them to expand their relationship with the bank.\n",

    "   - **Financial status**: Low or Moderate\n",
    "   - **Loyalty**: High\n",
    "   - **Business Insight**: These customers are financially modest but loyal users of the bank’s services. Likely middle-income earners or individuals working to improve their credit, they could benefit from value-driven offerings such as cashback credit cards or debt consolidation services. Providing budgeting tools and financial education through digital channels may help improve their financial well-being.\n",

    "5. **Casual Browsers**:\n",
    "   - **Financial status**: Moderate or Low\n",
    "   - **Loyalty**: Moderate or Low\n",
    "   - **Business Insight**: This segment includes customers who lack strong financial activity or engagement. They could be occasional users, young professionals, or middle-income families. Focus on financial education, bundling products, or targeted campaigns to address their potential needs, such as home loans or long-term savings plans. If they are digitally capable, encourage app-based interactions; otherwise, engage through physical channels.\n",
