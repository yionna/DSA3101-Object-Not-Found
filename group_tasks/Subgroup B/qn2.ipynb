    "Before proceeding, we need to clarify the purpose of the campaign. The campaign aims to make customers more active, encourage them to purchase banking products, and increase their transaction volume with their accounts at the bank. The banking products include: savings accounts, credit cards, loans (categorized as personal loans, including home and car loans; commercial loans, mainly for businesses), investment products (such as funds and fixed deposits), and insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what types of campaigns can we consider? The first category focuses on increasing customer activity. We could take inspiration from DBS:\n",
    "1. Collaborate with other businesses. For instance, offer discounts or reward points if customers use DBS to pay on Shopee, thereby incentivizing spending.\n",
    "2. Directly stimulate spending. For example, offer a 100 cashback if monthly spending reaches 1500.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second category focuses on promoting the purchase of banking products:\n",
    "- **Savings Accounts**: Usually the first product customers open with the bank, so the main goal is to keep customers active. We can rely on activity-based campaigns (the first type) to retain savings account customers.\n",
    "- **Credit Cards and Personal Loans**: These can be tailored based on customer spending behaviors. Different spending levels may be associated with different credit card limits, while loans can be offered through two main methods:\n",
    "  1. Trigger Mechanism: If a customer browses loan-related products in the bank app, automatically push relevant loan services.\n",
    "  2. Recent Transactions: If there are multiple large transactions, this could signal a need for substantial funds, and we can offer a commercial loan.\n",
    "  3. For personal loans, use the customer’s location (captured by the bank app). For instance, if a customer has visited car or real estate businesses but hasn’t completed a transaction, offer a time-limited, low-interest loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insurance**: Divided into commercial insurance and personal insurance. For customers who have recently visited medical facilities, recommend suitable personal insurance; bundle commercial insurance with commercial loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Investment Products**: Recommend these based on the customer’s account balance. If the balance reaches a certain threshold, recommend suitable investment products. If a customer stays on a specific investment product page in the app for over 30 seconds, push a limited-time offer for that product.\n",
    "\n",
    "This layered campaign strategy can help target customer needs more precisely."
